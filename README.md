Note: at the beggining you need a seed admin in order to create other users. Please create a seed user with role admin (role admin = 0) at the database before using the app. For example, you can add this row to the users database: Email: seedAdmin@gmail.com, Password: seedAdmin1, Name: Seedadmin, LastName: SeedAdminLastname, Role: 0
